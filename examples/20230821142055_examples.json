However, the theory does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed discrepancy. In fact, MOND actually increases the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass and the measured velocity dispersions.

Its usage may also be related to the Greek name of Sicily, Trinacria, which means \"having three headlands.\" The head of Medusa at the center of the Sicilian triskeles represents the three headlands.\nOption B: The triskeles symbol is a representation of three interlinked spirals, which was adopted as an emblem by the rulers of Syracuse. Its usage in modern flags of Sicily has its origins in the ancient Greek name for the island, Trinacria, which means \"Sicily with three corners.\" The head of Medusa at the center is a representation of the island's rich cultural heritage.\nOption C: The triskeles symbol is a representation of a triple goddess, reconstructed by the rulers of Syracuse, who adopted it as an emblem. Its significance lies in the fact that it represents the Greek name for Sicily, Trinacria, which contains the element \"tria,\" meaning three. The head of Medusa at the center of the Sicilian triskeles represents the three headlands.\nOption D: The triskeles symbol represents three interlocked spiral arms, which became an emblem for the rulers of Syracuse. Its usage in modern flags of Sicily is due to the island's rich cultural heritage, which dates back to ancient times. The head of Medusa at the center represents the lasting influence of Greek mythology on Sicilian culture.\nOption E: The triskeles symbol is a representation of the Greek goddess Hecate, reconstructed by the rulers of Syracuse. Its adoption as an emblem was due to its cultural significance, as it represented the ancient Greek name for Sicily, Trinacria. The head of Medusa at the center of the Sicilian triskeles represents the island's central location in the Mediterranean.
